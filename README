This aims to be a complete binding of the SDL2 media library to Lua using the
Lux emitter. It provides Lua with all of the cross-platform video/audio/input
functions as well as the more advanced utilities of CPU feature detection and
pre-emptive mult-threading with mutual exclusion locks. There is also support
for many other libraries in the SDL family:

	SDL2
	SDL2_image
	SDL2_ttf
	SDL2_mixer
	SDL2_net
	SDL2_gfx

The API is split up into binary modules according to the division that SDL2
itself divides into C headers, so that a Lua script can import as little or
as much of the API as required. Function and structure names are identical;
documentation for the C library functions is nearly equivalent for SDL2_lua.

There is very little massaging of the C API in this binding, so that the user
is required to (for example) free their own resources rather than rely on the
garbage collector. But it would be a simple matter for the user to code these
if desired.
